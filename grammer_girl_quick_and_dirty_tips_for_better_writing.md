## How to write straightforward sentences

One way to keep your sentence straightforward to make sure your subject and verb together at the beginning of the sentence

Reader wants to know right away who and what is doing something

~~~bash
// straightforward
we brush the dogs after their breakfast and playtime.
// non straightforward
After their breakfast and playtime, we brush the dogs

here,
we is subject
brush is verb
their is pronoun
dogs is noun
~~~

subject and verb should be beginning of the sentence. Noun should be comes before pronoun

~~~bash
Angela quickly trimmed the hair inside Bodie's ears.
Angela trimmed the hair inside Bodie's ears quickly.

In first sentence, 
quickly(adverb) is placed in between Angela(subject) and trimmed(verb) which is straightforward

In second sentence, quickly(adverb) added at the end of subject. which is sound awkward. 

~~~


** Its more straightforward to keep adverb and verb together **

To keep your writings straightforward and easy to understand, keep your subject close to the beginning of the sentence and keep words that act together, close together.
